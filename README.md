# MiniJS8

A self-contained JS8 transceiver controller for amateur radio. Runs on a
Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with a 240×240 SPI display, two GPIO buttons, and a
USB keyboard. Drives any radio paired with a QDX or DigiRig (G90, Baofeng etc) —
RTS for PTT, USB audio for I/Q.

JS8 is great for low-power messaging but JS8Call wants a full laptop.
This is a headless appliance: power up, navigate the screen ring with
arrow keys, type messages with the keyboard, hold both GPIO buttons to
shut down.

## Hardware

| Component | Notes |
|---|---|
| SBC | Raspberry Pi Zero 2W (Bookworm 64-bit) |
| Display | Adafruit Mini PiTFT 1.3" 240×240 colour display mounted directly on the Pi's GPIO header |
| Sound + PTT | DigiRig (USB audio + RTS keying) |
| Radio | QDX (tested), G90, or any rig DigiRig speaks to |
| GPS | gpsd-compatible (for grid + slot-time when chrony is unavailable) |
| Input | USB keyboard, 2× GPIO buttons (backlight / shutdown gesture) |

## Screens

Cycle with ← / → on the keyboard:

`HOME · HEARD · DIRECTED · INBOX · COMPOSE · ALLCALL · DIRECTED MENU · EMERGENCY · SETUP`

- **HEARD** — recently-heard stations with SNR, distance, bearing
- **DIRECTED** — chat-style activity log (inbound white, outbound red)
- **INBOX** — buffered MSG mailbox (Enter to read, Del to delete)
- **COMPOSE** — TO / CMD (FREE/MSG/STORE/AGN?/SNR?/GRID/QUERY/MYLOC) / TEXT / SEND
- **EMERGENCY** — bypasses unconfigured-station TX lock for life-safety traffic

## Software stack

- Python 3.11 async event loop
- [gfsk8 fork](https://github.com/W5DMH/gfsk8-modem-clean) — JS8 modem core (separated from JS8Call's Qt UI)
- SQLite for outbound queue, inbox, and message store
- chrony OR multi-frame consensus for slot-time alignment (operator never has to set the clock)

## Build

See `build.sh` for the image-from-scratch recipe. It assumes a fresh
Raspberry Pi OS Lite Bookworm install on a Pi Zero 2W. The build wires
up the display kernel module, gpsd, the gfsk8 wheel, the systemd unit,
and a default config.

## Test

```bash
git clone https://github.com/W5DMH/minijs8.git
cd minijs8
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
pytest
```

The test suite is host-runnable — no Pi hardware needed. The audio,
display, GPIO, and gfsk8 layers all have headless stubs.
