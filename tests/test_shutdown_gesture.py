"""Tests for the shared ShutdownGesture + keyboard Ctrl-X path.

Covers:
  - ShutdownGesture.arm() / cancel() / is_armed() basics
  - Idempotent arm (two paths racing)
  - Cancel from a different "source" than the arm (button release
    can cancel a keyboard-armed countdown and vice versa)
  - Countdown completion invokes the callback
  - Router Ctrl-X arms the shared gesture
  - Router Esc on SHUTTING_DOWN cancels
