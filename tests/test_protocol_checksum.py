"""Tests for the JS8 CRC-16/KERMIT + base-41 checksum module.

The single most important test in this file is the on-air-verified
known-good vector: ``checksum16("HELLO FROM REFERENCE") == "J6X"``.
That vector was captured from a real reference station's TX (KD8PGB)
during the multi-frame reassembly bring-up — if it ever stops
matching, our checksum implementation has drifted from JS8Call's
and we need to look at the C++ source again before shipping.

The rest of the tests cover edge cases (empty strings, whitespace,
mismatch, malformed input) so the assembler's behavior on partial /
corrupt frames is well-defined.
