"""Regression tests for the May 14 2026 on-air capture from W5DMH:

  1. ``_classify_directed_body`` crashed on whitespace-only body
     (IndexError at grammar.py:260). Caused parser failures that
     orphaned multi-frame directed-message continuations, breaking
     long free-text wrap testing.

  2. HEARTBEAT replies that include JS8Call's piggy-backed
     ``MSG ID <n>`` extension (e.g. ``KD8PGB: W5DMH HEARTBEAT SNR
     +04 MSG ID 61``) span two frames. Before the fix, the
     HEARTBEAT first-frame dispatched immediately as single-frame
     and the ``MSG ID 61`` continuation arrived orphaned (no buffer
     at the bucket) and was dropped. The fix adds DIRECTED
     HEARTBEAT to the non-buffered starter set so continuations
     attach.

  3. JS8 sometimes doesn't emit an inter-field space at frame
     boundaries when the field break aligns with the frame break.
     Wire ``...+04 MSG...`` arrives as ``+04`` (end of frame 1)
     and ``MSG`` (start of frame 2) — naïve concat yields
     ``+04MSG``. A narrow digit→uppercase-letter heuristic inserts
     a single space at the join, but ONLY for non-buffered
     commands (buffered commands have a CRC suffix that must be
     concatenated exactly, no space insertion).
