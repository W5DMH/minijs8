"""Tests for minijs8.input.keyboard.

We don't open real /dev/input/eventN — instead we use a fake evdev
device that yields scripted events. This validates the keymap +
modifier handling without needing actual evdev installed (it IS
installed via deps, but we want determinism).

The discovery / device-open path is exercised separately with a
filesystem mock.
