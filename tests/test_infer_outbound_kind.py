"""Tests for ``infer_outbound_kind`` — the verb-based classifier that
keeps outbound queries from accidentally entering WAIT_ACK and
looping forever.

This is the safety net for the on-air bug observed in the bench-test
log: an outbound ``"KD8PGB QUERY MSGS"`` was queued with kind=DIRECTED
by some manual test path. The scheduler put it in WAIT_ACK, no ACK
ever came (correctly — JS8Call doesn't ACK queries), and we
retransmitted every 90 s for three attempts before abandoning.

The classifier guarantees that ANY caller (manual tooling, future
Compose UI, CLI helpers, REPL sessions) gets the right kind
automatically, even if they forget to specify one.

Coverage groups:

  1. Buffered-MSG verbs → DIRECTED (recipient auto-ACKs)
  2. Query / notification verbs → REPLY (no ACK expected)
  3. Edge cases: empty, whitespace-only, no verb, unknown verb
  4. Case-insensitivity (JS8Call upper-cases on TX)
  5. Multi-word "MSG TO:" handling (must beat plain MSG check)
