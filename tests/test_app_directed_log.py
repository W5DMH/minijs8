"""Tests for the decode-handler's directed-activity logging path.

Regression coverage for the bug where HEARTBEAT replies (and other
non-ACK single-frame directed responses) were decoded correctly but
did NOT appear in the DIRECTED chat view. The decode handler's
filter was overly narrow (``kind is FrameKind.ACK``) when it should
have logged ALL non-buffered single-frame frames directed at us.

These tests drive ``_on_decoded_frame`` end-to-end with synthetic
DecodedFrames and assert on the resulting DirectedActivityLog state.
