"""Regression tests for the May 15 2026 GPS null-island bug.

Bug history (W5DMH bench, May 2026): operator built a fresh image
and tested the EMERGENCY screen. With the home page showing
``3D fix (6 sat)``, the emergency page showed ``+0.0000, +0.0000``
for lat/lon — bogus coordinates instead of either the real position
or an "acquiring" indicator.

Root causes:

  1. ``_tpv_to_fix`` passed through gpsd's null-island sentinel —
     when gpsd has the time/ephemeris parts to call a fix mode-3
     but hasn't yet computed coordinates, it emits ``lat=0, lon=0``.
     We forwarded those zeros to the UI which faithfully rendered
     +0.0000 +0.0000.

  2. The HOME ``_gps_status_label`` only inspected ``kind`` and
     ``satellites_used``, declaring "3D fix (6 sat)" even when the
     fix had no usable position. Operators saw mixed signals: HOME
     said we were location-ready, EMERGENCY said we weren't.

Both fixes restore consistency: the parser nullifies null-island
coordinates, and the home label promotes "3D fix" only when
``has_position`` is True (else amber "acquiring").
