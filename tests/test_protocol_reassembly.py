"""Tests for the multi-frame message reassembler.

Goals of this suite (in priority order):

1. **Replay the on-air KD8PGB scenario.** The reference station's
   actual TX of "W5DMH MSG HELLO FROM REFERENCE" arrived in 3 frames.
   If this exact sequence ever fails to reassemble, the bench test
   would fail too — so this test is the canary for protocol-level
   regression.

2. **Verb-only commands.** QUERY MSGS direct-to-us (and @ALLCALL)
   doesn't have a body or checksum and must emit immediately.

3. **Single-frame messages with body+checksum.** Short MSGs that fit
   in one continuation frame.

4. **Timeout eviction.** Buffers that never receive a continuation
   must drop after 30 s without consuming memory forever.

5. **Interleaved transmissions.** Multiple stations TX'ing on
   different audio offsets must produce separate buffers; their
   continuation frames must route correctly.

6. **Wrong-checksum drop.** Corrupt continuation that fills the
   buffer with the right text count but wrong CRC chars must NOT
   emit (the JS8Call protocol has no fallback path here).

# ── 10. Multi-frame buffered MSG with mid-space frame boundary ────────
#
# The on-air bug from the bench-test log: KD8PGB sent a 4-frame MSG
# ("MSG TEST STORAGE MESSAGE STORED ON REFERENCE 1 FROM KD8PGB") and
# our reassembler concatenated the frames as "TEST STORAGE MESSAGE
# STOREDON REFERENCE 1 FROM KD8PGB" — missing the space between
# "STORED" and "ON" because both grammar.py and reassembly.py were
# stripping trailing whitespace at multiple stages.
#
# The fix: trust gfsk8 (which preserves whole-character boundaries
# per packHuffMessage L1935) and stop stripping inter-frame whitespace.
