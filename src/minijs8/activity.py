"""In-memory log of directed protocol activity.

Tracks the recent back-and-forth between our station and other stations
for protocol-level (non-mail) directed exchanges — SNR?, INFO, GRID?,
QUERY MSGS, QUERY MSG <id>, ACK, etc. The DIRECTED screen renders this
as a chat-style chronological view so the operator can see the full
round-trip of each query.

Why in-memory and not persisted
================================

The decision (this session, with the operator) was to use a bounded
in-memory ring buffer rather than a SQLite table. Reasoning:

  - Directed traffic is high-volume and ephemeral; the operator cares
    about "what's been happening lately", not "what happened last
    week." Three days from now nobody needs to know that KC1WDO asked
    for our SNR.
  - Persistence buys us nothing on a daemon-restart timeline (you'd
    typically be restarting because something broke; you don't need
    pre-restart chat history to debug).
  - A SQLite schema is more code, more tests, more migrations, more
    surface for bugs. A deque is 80 lines and trivially correct.

If we ever want history retention, swap the storage backend without
changing the call sites — the API surface here is intentionally small.

Bounds
======

Max 200 entries. At a typical ~5 directed exchanges per active hour
that's ~40 hours of working memory. Tunable via the constructor for
tests; production constructs it with the default.

Concurrency
===========

The decode handler runs on the asyncio loop thread, but TX logging
fires from the same thread that calls ``_enqueue_directed_reply``
(also asyncio loop). So in practice we're single-threaded. We lock
defensively anyway because the cost is negligible (~100 ns per call)
and the failure mode without it (snapshot reading mid-append) would
be a heisenbug we'd never reproduce.
