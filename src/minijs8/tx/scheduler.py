"""Slot-aligned TX scheduler.

Once per JS8 slot (every 15 s), the scheduler:

  1. Walks the queue's WAIT_ACK rows and processes any that have
     timed out (re-queue for retry or abandon, based on attempt count).

  2. Picks the next QUEUED message (FIFO).

  3. Runs the safety checks (callsign, GPS, chrony, frame-rate limit).

  4. If all checks pass, calls TxBackend.transmit() inline and updates
     state based on the result.

  5. Sleeps until the next slot boundary.

The scheduler runs on its own thread, separate from the asyncio loop.
TxBackend.transmit() blocks for ~12-13 seconds (the duration of the
JS8 audio frame) — putting that on the asyncio loop would freeze the
UI and decoder pipelines. A dedicated thread keeps everything else
responsive.

Slot timing
-----------

JS8 slots are UTC-aligned to multiples of 15 seconds. We TX at the
START of each slot — that's the protocol convention so receivers
know when to expect signal. The scheduler wakes ~50 ms before the
slot boundary so we have time to do queue work, then PTT-on at the
boundary itself.

Concretely:
  - At slot_start - 200 ms: pick next message, do safety checks
  - At slot_start - 50 ms: call TxBackend.transmit(); ptt_on_delay
    (150 ms for QDX) puts actual audio start at slot_start + 100 ms,
    well within JS8's ±1 s tolerance.

Safety checks (all 4 from Step 6 spec)
--------------------------------------

  1. Callsign must not be N0CALL (unless emergency override)
  2. Configured grid must be set (unless emergency override)
  3. GPS fix required when emergency override (unconfigured station)
  4. chrony must report a sync source

Rate limit
----------

The scheduler enforces "max 1 TX per slot" by design — it runs once
per slot and only ever does one transmit per loop iteration. No extra
guard needed at the API surface.

Frame rate limit (additional)
-----------------------------

For repeat scheduling (heartbeats firing every 30 min), we never let
a slot's transmit overlap with the next slot. JS8 Normal frames are
~12.6 s; if for some reason a transmit overruns, the next slot's
transmit is suppressed (the queue waits another full slot).

# When the scheduler should fire relative to a slot boundary.
#
# We fire SHORTLY AFTER the slot boundary, not before it, because
# ``transmit_frame()`` does per-frame wall-clock alignment that
# targets ``slot_boundary + 500 ms`` (the JS8 protocol's delay_ms —
# see ``Modulator::start()`` in JS8Call's source). Firing after the
# boundary keeps mstr small (typically 50-300 ms), which is the
# regime where pipeline-latency compensation works cleanly.
#
# Concretely: scheduler wakes at ``slot_boundary + _TARGET_OFFSET_S``,
# does queue work + safety check, calls ``start_burst()`` (PTT-on +
# settle), then calls ``transmit_frame()`` which reads wall clock
# and computes silence using JS8Call's round-up formula to land
# modulation at the next 500 ms boundary in the slot.
#
# About firing late: thanks to JS8Call's round-up formula,
# transmit_frame() never fails on timing — if mstr is past 500 ms,
# it just rounds up to the next 500 ms boundary in the slot
# (modulation lands at slot+1000 ms instead of slot+500 ms). This
# eliminates the "too late to align" failure mode that earlier
# versions had to defend against. Hitting slot+500 ms cleanly is
# still the goal, but missing it is no longer fatal — just a
# quality-of-decode tradeoff (more boundaries in the slot are
# acceptable but use more on-air time).
#
# Margin breakdown (typical, on Pi Zero 2W with QDX):
#
#   _TARGET_OFFSET_S         10 ms  (this constant — when we wake)
#   queue work / mark_sending 5 ms  (DB UPDATE round-trip)
#   start_burst CAT roundtrip 30 ms (USB serial PTT-on)
#   ptt_on_delay_ms          50 ms  (radio settle, per-radio config)
#   ───────────────────────────────
#   total before transmit_frame's wall-clock read: ~95 ms
#
# That puts transmit_frame's mstr around 95 ms, well under the
# 500 ms first boundary — clean alignment with no round-up needed.

# Burst watchdog: per-frame budget for a multi-frame TX. If the burst
# isn't complete after ``n_frames × _BURST_WATCHDOG_PER_FRAME_S``
# seconds, the scheduler force-ends the burst and abandons the
# message.
#
# Why a watchdog at all: we're holding PTT continuously across slot
# boundaries. If anything goes wrong between frames (Python exception
# in audio chain, scheduler thread hang, daemon stuck on I/O), PTT
# could remain keyed indefinitely. That's bad for the radio (PA
# stress, possible damage on long carrier), bad for the band
# (jamming), and bad for our credibility on-air. The watchdog is a
# defense in depth.
#
# Why 20 s per frame:
#   slot duration         15 s
#   frame audio duration  ~12.64 s (well within slot)
#   inter-frame gap       ~2.4 s (PTT held, no audio)
#   ─────────────────────────────────
#   normal per-frame time:  ~15 s
#   safety margin:           5 s
#   = 20 s/frame budget
#
# Examples:
#   1-frame heartbeat → 20 s deadline
#   3-frame MSG       → 60 s deadline
#   5-frame longer    → 100 s deadline
#
# If we hit this watchdog, something is genuinely wrong — we don't
# retry, we abandon the message with an explicit watchdog error so
# the operator sees what happened.

#     and runs proper cleanup: ``end_burst()``, mark row abandoned,
#     log loudly. Operator sees a clean error.
#
#   * **CAT layer** (``CatService._watchdog_loop()``) is a final
#     safety net. It fires at ``scheduler_deadline + _CAT_WATCHDOG_GRACE_S``
#     and just yanks PTT off — useful only if the scheduler itself
#     has stopped running (its thread crashed, deadlocked, etc.).
#
# 5 seconds is enough for the scheduler's once-per-slot wakeup to
