"""Outbound message queue + retry state machine.

The queue is the single source of truth for "messages we want to TX".
Backed by a SQLite ``outbound`` table so queued messages survive a
daemon restart — a request typed by the operator at 22:00 will still
be queued at 22:01 even if the daemon crashed in between.

State machine
-------------

::

  QUEUED ──[scheduler picks me up, attempt #1]──> SENDING
  SENDING ──[TxBackend says success]─> WAIT_ACK / DELIVERED
  WAIT_ACK ──[ACK arrived]──> DELIVERED
  WAIT_ACK ──[90s elapsed, attempts < 3]──> QUEUED  (re-queue for retry)
  WAIT_ACK ──[90s elapsed, attempts >= 3]──> ABANDONED
  SENDING ──[TxBackend said no]──> QUEUED  (retry)

States are durable. The scheduler walks the table once per slot,
finds the next eligible row (oldest QUEUED), and asks TxBackend to
send it. State transitions are recorded in the same row.

Special handling per message kind:

  - HEARTBEAT, CQ, ALLCALL broadcasts have no specific recipient → never
    WAIT_ACK, go straight from SENDING to DELIVERED on a successful TX.
  - REPLY messages (auto-ACK to a received MSG, QUERY MSGS notification
    replies like "<asker> NO" or "<asker> MSG <id>") are directed at a
    specific callsign but per JS8Call protocol the recipient does NOT
    auto-ACK them — they're terminal in the protocol exchange. Treated
    like broadcasts for state-machine purposes: SENDING → DELIVERED.
  - DIRECTED messages (operator-typed messages, QUERY MSG <id> body
    deliveries that use the MSG verb) wait 90 s for an ACK after each
    TX attempt. The recipient's station auto-ACKs these.

Queue depth is capped at 3 (per spec) — additional ``enqueue()``
calls when full return False so the UI can flag "queue full".

ACK matching uses ``to_call`` + first-token-match-ish checks. The
scheduler feeds ACK frames to ``record_ack()`` whenever the protocol
parser produces ``FrameKind.ACK``; we match by from-call (the ACK's
sender is who we sent to).

# ── OutboundKind inference ─────────────────────────────────────────


def infer_outbound_kind(text: str) -> OutboundKind:
    """Classify outbound text by examining its verb after the recipient.

    Used as a fallback when callers of ``enqueue`` / ``enqueue_for_encoding``
    don't supply an explicit ``kind``. Encodes the protocol-correct
    convention so manual tooling and future Compose-UI code can't
    accidentally re-introduce the "DIRECTED-kind on a query loops"
    bug we hit on-air.

    The convention
    --------------
    Outbound directed text follows the form ``"<recipient> <verb>
    [<body>]"``. The ``verb`` token determines whether the recipient's
    JS8Call will auto-ACK us:

      DIRECTED   ← ``MSG`` or ``MSG TO:`` — these are buffered mail
                   commands and the recipient's JS8Call auto-ACKs
                   the body delivery. The scheduler MUST put these
                   in WAIT_ACK so the inbound ACK closes the loop.

      REPLY      ← anything else: ``ACK``, ``NO``, ``YES``, ``QUERY
                   MSGS``, ``QUERY MSG <id>``, ``QUERY CALL``,
                   ``SNR?``, ``INFO``, ``GRID?``, ``STATUS``,
                   ``HEARING?``, etc. The recipient does NOT auto-ACK
                   these; their answer message (if any) IS the
                   protocol response. Putting these in WAIT_ACK
                   creates an infinite retransmit loop because no
                   ACK ever arrives.

    Broadcasts (HEARTBEAT, CQ, ALLCALL) are NOT inferred from text —
    callers must specify those explicitly. We can't reliably tell
    "@HB" from a normal directed message just by looking at the text.

    Edge cases
    ----------
    - Empty text → REPLY (safe default; will fail downstream anyway)
    - Text without any whitespace ("ACK" alone) → REPLY (treated as
      verb-only)
    - "MSG TO:" with no body or recipient → still DIRECTED (treated
      conservatively; the scheduler will see no ACK and abandon
      after retries, which is correct degradation)
    - Case-insensitive verb matching (JS8Call normalizes to upper
      case on TX, so "msg" matches MSG).
