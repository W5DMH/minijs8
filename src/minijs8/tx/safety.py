"""TX safety gate — the four hard checks before any transmission.

Per Step 6 spec, all four of these MUST pass before TxBackend.transmit
is called:

  1. Callsign must not be N0CALL — except in emergency override.
  2. Configured grid must be set — except in emergency override.
  3. GPS fix required when emergency override is active (the bypass
     allows N0CALL but we still need a real grid for SOS to be useful).
  4. A usable time source must be available — chrony OR consensus.
     JS8 protocol requires ±1 s time accuracy; without sync we'd
     splatter the band.

Phase Y addition: time-source check delegates to
``time_source.time_source_status()``, which considers both chrony
sync state AND the running consensus from decoded JS8 frames. This
allows TX in basement / no-GPS scenarios where chrony has no upstream
but the radio is hearing other stations.

Frame-rate is enforced by the scheduler's structure (one TX per slot
loop iteration), not by this module.

Construct with refs to UIState (for emergency-override state), the
``Config`` (for callsign/grid identity), a chrony-status function,
and optionally a TimingTracker for consensus fallback.
