"""JS8 multi-frame message reassembly.

JS8 transmits messages longer than ~13 characters across multiple
back-to-back 15-second slots. The receive-side decoder hands us each
frame independently — gfsk8.Decoder produces one ``Decoded`` per
frame, with no automatic concatenation. This module reassembles
those frame sequences into complete messages so the inbox dispatch
layer can act on them.

Protocol shape
==============

The first frame of a multi-frame message carries the directed-
message envelope: ``"<from>: <to> <CMD>"`` where CMD is one of the
buffered commands (MSG, MSG TO:, QUERY MSGS, QUERY CALL, QUERY,
relay ``>``, CMD). The body text starts after the verb. If the body
fits in the first frame's remaining space, the message is single-
frame. Otherwise it spills into subsequent frames as pure text
continuations — no envelope, no callsign, just the next chunk of
the body.

Continuation frames decode to ``FrameKind.UNKNOWN`` in our parser
because they don't have the directed-message envelope. We identify
them by audio offset (within tolerance) and proximity in time to a
recently-started buffer.

End-of-message triggers
=======================

We declare a buffered message complete when ANY of these fires:

1. **Checksum validates** (preferred): the assembled body ends with
   a valid 3-char CRC-16/KERMIT checksum. This is the protocol-
   correct signal — JS8Call uses exactly this to decide when to
   ACK. Cheap to check on every continuation frame because the CRC
   table is precomputed and bodies are short.

2. **Timeout** (~30 s): no continuation frame at the buffer's audio
   offset for several slot-widths. The assembler emits whatever it
   has — but flagged as ``incomplete`` so the dispatcher knows not
   to ACK. Timeout is twice the slot width plus margin so a single
   missed decode in the middle of a 4-frame TX doesn't kill the
   buffer.

3. **End-of-transmission char** (``\\x04``): JS8Call appends EOT to
   the LAST frame after the checksum. We treat its presence as a
   completion signal even if the trailing text didn't validate —
   useful when the operator's checksum is corrupt but they still
   want the message displayed (we'd surface as incomplete).

Buffer key
==========

Each buffer is keyed by ``(from_call, to_call, audio_offset_hz)``
where ``audio_offset_hz`` is rounded to the nearest 25 Hz to absorb
the tiny per-decode jitter we see in practice. Two stations TX'ing
on different audio offsets can interleave without buffer collision,
and two stations on the SAME offset (collision) get correctly
discriminated by from-call + to-call.

Concurrency
===========

This module is NOT thread-safe by design — the only consumer is
the asyncio decode handler in app.py, which is single-threaded. If
that ever changes we'd add a Lock around the buffer dict, but for
now keeping it lock-free saves us a layer of complexity.

        non-buffered buffer to time out AND the current frame to
        complete a different buffer. Callers must iterate the list
        and dispatch each completion in order.

        Decision tree:

        1. **Stale-buffer sweep first.** Any non-buffered buffer that
           hasn't seen a frame in ``non_buffered_timeout_s`` (default
           20s, ~one slot) is treated as complete and emitted with
           ``checksum_valid=True`` — the message is "done" by
           protocol convention. Buffered buffers that timeout are
           NOT auto-emitted here (they go through ``sweep_timeouts``
           with checksum_valid=False so the dispatcher can decide
           whether to surface or drop them).

        2. **Buffered-command starter.** Frame is a directed message
           whose first verb-token is in the buffered_cmds set. Emit
           any existing same-key buffer first (preempt), then handle
           via ``_on_buffered_starter``. May complete in one frame
           (single-frame body+checksum) or kick off multi-frame
           waiting.

        3. **Non-buffered directed starter.** Frame is DIRECTED_*
           with a real callsign envelope but the verb is NOT in the
           buffered set. Emit any same-key buffer first, then start
           a fresh non-buffered buffer. Won't complete until timeout
           or new starter at same offset.

        4. **Continuation.** Frame is UNKNOWN with a body. Append to
           the most-recently-started buffer at the same audio
           offset. If buffered → maybe-validate-checksum. If non-
           buffered → no completion check; wait for timeout.

        5. **Unrelated.** Heartbeat, CQ, ACK, broadcast, etc. — no
           buffer interaction.

        or "W5DMH SNR -10" (single-frame), or "W5DMH STATUS All quiet"
        (potentially multi-frame).

        Behavior:

        1. If a buffer already exists at the same (from, to, offset)
           key, **emit it first as preempted** (operator's seeing a
           new TX from the same station at the same offset, the old
           buffer is conceptually finished). Then start fresh.

        2. The new buffer captures the FULL body of frame 1
           (verb-token included), because non-buffered messages
           don't have a separate "verb prefix" + "rest" structure
           the way buffered commands do — the body is just text,
           and the operator wants to see all of it.

        3. We do NOT emit the new buffer immediately. Even though
           it might be a single-frame TX, JS8Call protocol allows
           continuations in the next slot. We wait for either
           timeout (one slot + grace) or a new same-offset starter.
