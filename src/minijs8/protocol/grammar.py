"""JS8 directed-message grammar parser.

The GFSK8 wrapper hands us a Varicode-unpacked text string per decoded
frame. This module classifies that text into a ``ParsedFrame`` so the
rest of the daemon can react appropriately (heartbeat → just heard list,
directed-to-us → notify, etc.).

JS8 message conventions (from the JS8Call source AND on-air observation
of real traffic captured Apr 2026 on 7.078 MHz):

  Heartbeat (legacy):   "<call> @HB <grid>"
                        Older JS8Call versions; no colon, no "HEARTBEAT".

  Heartbeat (modern):   "<call>: @HB HEARTBEAT <grid>"
                        Current JS8Call format. Includes "@HB" as the
                        to-field plus the literal word HEARTBEAT, then
                        the sender's grid.

  Heartbeat reply:      "<call>: <other> HEARTBEAT SNR <db>"
                        e.g.  "K8IMT: K3CLR HEARTBEAT SNR -10"
                        Sent in response to seeing someone's HB. Does
                        NOT carry the sender's grid — just the SNR
                        report. Still classified as HEARTBEAT for
                        Heard-list purposes (the sending station is
                        active right now), but grid stays None.

  CQ:                   "<call>: CQ <grid>"
                        "<call>: CQ CQ <grid>"  (modern, doubled)
                        "<call>: @ALLCALL CQ <grid>"
                        "<call>: @ALLCALL CQ CQ <grid>"

  All-call broadcast:   "<call>: @ALLCALL <text>"

  Directed message:     "<from>: <to> <text>"
                        e.g.  "K8XYZ: K1ABC HELLO HOW ARE YOU"

  Directed query:       "<from>: <to> <CMD>?"

  Directed cmd:         "<from>: <to> <CMD> <ARG>"

  ACK reply:            "<from>: <to> ACK -<snr>"

We don't need every documented sub-command in Step 5 — most just need
to be classified correctly so the screen knows where to put them. Step 6
adds per-command handling for outgoing replies.
