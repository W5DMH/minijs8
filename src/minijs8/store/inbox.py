"""JS8Call-compatible inbox / mailbox store.

This module manages the operator's mailbox — a persistent store of
inbound directed messages (UNREAD/READ), held mail we're storing for
other stations (STORE), and delivered held mail (DELIVERED). Stored
in a separate SQLite database (``/var/minijs8/inbox.db``) from the
decode log so the two have independent lifetimes and retention rules.

Schema design philosophy
========================

We adopt JS8Call's actual schema verbatim — one polymorphic table
``inbox_v1`` with a JSON blob discriminated by ``$.type``, plus
expression indices on the JSON paths the application queries by.
Reasons for matching JS8Call exactly rather than a Python-native
typed-column design:

* **Interoperability.** If we ever expose the JS8Call TCP API, the
  blob shape is what the API speaks. Same-shape storage means clients
  can talk to our station the same way they talk to JS8Call.
* **Protocol IDs are simpler.** The row's ``AUTOINCREMENT id`` IS the
  JS8 protocol message id. We transmit it directly in
  ``QUERY MSG <id>`` and HB-ACK piggyback (`MSG <id>`). No mapping
  layer.
* **Future-proofness.** Adding new states is a new ``type`` value, not
  a schema migration.
* **Reference compatibility.** A JS8Call inbox.db3 dropped onto our
  system can be read directly. Less of a footgun for operators
  migrating between stacks.

The downside — JSON-in-text isn't idiomatic Python — is mitigated by
the JSON-path indices being indexed by SQLite ≥ 3.38 (Pi Bookworm
ships 3.40). Lookups by FROM/TO/type are O(log n).

Type lifecycle
==============

::

   UNREAD ────[mark_read]───→ READ ────[delete]───→ (gone)
                                  ↑
                     [delete]─────┘
   UNREAD ────[delete]──────────────────────────→ (gone)

   STORE ─────[mark_delivered]──→ DELIVERED ────[delete]──→ (gone)
   STORE ─────[delete]──────────────────────────────────→ (gone)

* ``UNREAD`` — addressed to us, decoded as ``<from>: <us> MSG <body>``.
  Auto-ACK was sent at decode time (in app.py); the row just sits
  here waiting for the operator to read it.
* ``READ`` — operator viewed the detail-view of a UNREAD row.
* ``STORE`` — held mail. Either the operator stored it via the
  "Store Locally for <CALLSIGN>" action (FROM=our_call), OR a remote
  station gave us ``MSG TO:`` to hold (FROM=remote_sender). The TO
  field is always the eventual recipient. When that recipient sends
  ``QUERY MSGS`` and we deliver, we transition to DELIVERED on their
  ACK.
* ``DELIVERED`` — held mail that's been retrieved and ACK'd. Kept
  for operator audit but no longer offered in QUERY MSGS responses.

Blob shape (matches JS8Call's params layout)
============================================

::

   {
     "type": "UNREAD" | "READ" | "STORE" | "DELIVERED",
     "params": {
       "FROM":   "<callsign>",     # sender of the message
       "TO":     "<callsign>",     # destination (us for UNREAD/READ;
                                   #              recipient for STORE/DELIVERED)
       "TEXT":   "<body>",         # message text only (verb stripped)
       "UTC":    "ISO8601",        # when we received/stored it
       "OFFSET": <int>,            # audio frequency Hz at receipt; null for local-store
       "SNR":    <int>             # SNR at receipt; null for local-store
     }
   }

Concurrency model
=================

The decode pipeline is the writer (one thread, calling
``add_unread`` / ``add_remote_store``). The asyncio thread is the
reader (UI snapshot, QUERY MSGS lookup) and a writer for state
transitions (``mark_read``, ``mark_delivered``, ``delete``,
``add_local_store``). SQLite WAL mode supports concurrent
reader-while-writer; we open with ``check_same_thread=False`` so the
asyncio thread can call methods directly. All public methods are
short — no ``to_thread`` wrapping needed for the tiny per-row
operations involved.
