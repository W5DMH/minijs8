"""SQLite-backed append-only message store.

Schema:

  decodes      : every parsed frame, ever. Foundation for retention,
                 statistics, and forensic logging. WAL-mode SQLite for
                 concurrent read while the asyncio loop writes.

  heard_stations: most-recent-sighting cache (one row per callsign).
                  Updated on every decode. Read by the Heard List
                  screen at every redraw — kept small and indexed
                  by callsign so the read is O(log N) at most.

Design notes:

  - We use the stdlib ``sqlite3`` module directly. No ``aiosqlite``
    dep — its only benefit is non-blocking I/O, but our write rate is
    measured in *frames per second at most* (a few per slot), and the
    asyncio loop wraps each write in ``asyncio.to_thread`` so the
    event loop never blocks.

  - PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL gives us reads-during-writes without
    locking the entire database. PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL is the
    SD-card-friendly choice — slightly less crash-resistant than FULL,
    much less SD wear.

  - Retention runs once per hour: delete decodes older than the
    configured number of days (30 by default). Heard-station rows are
    NOT pruned by retention; they're a top-N cache and are evicted
    only when a callsign hasn't been heard in a long time AND the
    table has grown large.

The Step 5 surface is small: ``insert_decode``, ``upsert_heard_station``,
``recent_decodes``, ``heard_stations``, ``prune_older_than``. Step 6
will add outgoing-message tracking.
