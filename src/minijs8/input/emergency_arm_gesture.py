"""Emergency-beacon arm/disarm hold gesture.

Sibling to ``shutdown_gesture.ShutdownGesture``: a 3-second hold
gesture with progress feedback and explicit cancel. Difference is
this one runs in BOTH directions:

  - **Arming** (3-second hold of ENTER while beacon is idle) →
    on completion, calls ``arm_callback`` which fires up the
    EmergencyBeacon TX thread.
  - **Disarming** (3-second hold of ESC while beacon is armed) →
    on completion, calls ``disarm_callback`` which stops the
    EmergencyBeacon and clears the armed flag.

Both directions share a single asyncio task — only one hold can
be in progress at a time. The router decides which direction to
start based on the current ``emergency_beacon_armed`` flag.

Cancellation: pressing ESC during an arming hold, or pressing
ENTER during a disarming hold, cancels via ``cancel()``. The UI
state snaps back to "idle but possibly armed" (cancel does NOT
toggle the armed flag — it only aborts the in-flight transition).

Implementation note: keyboard events in MiniJS8 don't model
key-release, so this isn't a literal "hold the key down" gesture
the way the hardware-button shutdown is. Instead, the operator
presses the trigger key once and watches a 3-second countdown,
which is interruptible by pressing the cancel key. The visual
contract ("hold for 3 seconds") matches the operator's mental
model; the implementation just uses an asyncio timer instead of
GPIO press/release semantics.
