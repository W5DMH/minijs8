"""TFT button watcher.

Two physical buttons on the Adafruit Mini PiTFT 1.3":

    BUTTON_TOP    = GPIO23  (Adafruit silkscreen "Button A")
    BUTTON_BOTTOM = GPIO24  (Adafruit silkscreen "Button B")

Both are active-LOW with on-board 10k pull-ups. ``gpiozero.Button``
handles debounce and polarity for us.

The watcher's job is to translate raw button events into UI commands:

  - **Single short press** of either button → screen ring navigation
    (TOP=advance, BOTTOM=retreat). Fired on RELEASE, not on press, so
    a hold for the shutdown gesture doesn't flicker the ring on the
    way in.

  - **Both held** → start a 5-second shutdown timer. The UI switches
    to the SHUTTING_DOWN screen immediately, with a countdown bar
    that drains from full to empty over the 5 s. Releasing either
    button before the timer expires cancels.

  - **Both held to completion** → invoke ``shutdown_callback``, which
    in production is ``systemctl poweroff`` via the asyncio loop.

The shutdown timer is driven from the asyncio loop with
``asyncio.sleep(0.05)`` ticks, not from a thread or hardware timer —
this keeps the cancellation semantics simple (one Task, cancel on
release).

GPIO callbacks happen on a gpiozero-internal thread; we marshal events
into the asyncio loop with ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe()``.
