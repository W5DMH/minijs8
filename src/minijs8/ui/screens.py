"""Screen renderers.

Each renderer is a pure function: given a UI snapshot and a Fonts
bundle, it returns a fully-painted 240x240 ``PIL.Image`` ready to be
handed to the ST7789 driver. No global state, no I/O — that makes them
trivially testable on the host.

Layout convention (see ``theme.py``):

    +--- HEADER (28px) ----+
    |  TITLE          7/8  |    "7/8" = position-in-ring indicator
    +----------------------+    (omitted on screens not in the ring)
    |                      |
    |        BODY          |
    |                      |
