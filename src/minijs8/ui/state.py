"""UI state machine — the screen ring, field focus, and edit mode.

The state object is the single source of truth for what the display
thread renders. Every mutation goes through one of the methods here,
which:

  1. updates the relevant field, and
  2. sets the dirty flag so the render thread knows to redraw.

Concurrency: ``UIState`` is mutated only from the asyncio thread.
The render thread reads it via ``snapshot()``, which returns a frozen
``UISnapshot`` dataclass. The snapshot is immutable so the render
thread can take its time without worrying about torn reads.

Step 3 added field-focus and edit-mode state:

  - **Focus** is tracked per-screen as an integer index into a screen-
    local list of focusable items. The list of items is defined in
    ``_FOCUSABLE_FIELDS`` below.
  - **Edit mode** holds a per-edit (field name, working buffer,
    invalid-flag) tuple while a Setup field is being edited.
  - **Emergency override** is a one-way flag that an unconfigured
    station can flip via the Setup screen's "[EMERGENCY BEACON →]"
    button. Once set, ``tx_allowed`` reads as True and the operator
    can navigate to the Emergency screen. Per spec there's no return
    path until reboot.

        ``QUERY MSGS`` we deliver the stored body. The verb is held

    ``MSG_TO`` is store-and-forward via a relay station: we ask the

    callsign). The wire form is ``<TO> MSG TO:<FOR> <TEXT>``. The

    or a CMD that requires TEXT but TEXT is empty, or MSG TO with
    no FOR), OR if the operator targeted their own callsign — see
    the SELF-CALL note below.

    STORE is a special case: it returns ``None`` because nothing
    goes on the air for STORE. The caller (app.py's
    ``_compose_store_sync``) reads (to, text) directly from the

    convention) and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace. TEXT is
    used as-typed (whitespace-trimmed at the boundary, internal
    spaces preserved — the protocol layer handles multi-frame
    whitespace correctly per the reassembly fix).

    SELF-CALL note: the gfsk8 library (Varicode.cpp::buildMessageFrames,
    AUTO_REMOVE_MYCALL block) silently strips the leading callsign
    when it equals our own — operators sometimes type their own
    callsign as a prefix, and the protocol auto-adds the from-envelope
    so the prefix is redundant. This means a wire like
    "W5DMH MSG hi" (where W5DMH is our own call) gets encoded as
    just "MSG hi" — stripping the to-callsign entirely, producing
    a malformed frame with no directed-message envelope. The receiver
    sees plain text, not a directed MSG. We reject TO == my_call
    here to prevent silently-malformed transmissions for ALL
