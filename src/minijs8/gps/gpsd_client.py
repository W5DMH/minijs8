"""Minimal gpsd JSON-protocol client.

gpsd accepts TCP connections on port 2947 and emits line-delimited JSON.
Sending ``?WATCH={"enable":true,"json":true}`` opens the firehose. We
care about ``TPV`` reports (time, position, velocity); ``SKY`` reports
(satellite info) we use only to populate the satellites_used field.

We deliberately avoid the ``gpsd-py3`` PyPI package because it's
unmaintained (last release 2017) and is a thin wrapper around the same
JSON socket we can implement in 50 lines of stdlib. Fewer dependencies
== fewer aarch64 wheel headaches at image-build time.
