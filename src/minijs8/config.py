"""Configuration loading and validation for MiniJS8.

Configuration lives in TOML at ``paths.config_path()`` (default
``/var/minijs8/config.toml``). On first boot, if no live config exists,
the shipped defaults at ``paths.default_config_path()`` are copied in.

Callsign and grid validation follows amateur-radio convention:

  - **Callsign**: uppercase letters and digits, 3-10 characters. Matches
    the practical envelope of FCC/ITU callsigns (e.g. "K1ABC", "VE3XYZ",
    "JA1AAA/P"). The sentinel "N0CALL" is treated as *unconfigured* —
    parses cleanly so the daemon can boot, but ``tx_allowed`` is False.

  - **Grid**: Maidenhead locator, either 4-character ("FN42") or
    6-character ("FN42aa"). Empty string means unset; ``tx_allowed`` is
    False until at least a 4-character grid is supplied.

Any other validation failure raises ``ConfigError``. The daemon catches
this at startup and refuses to enter the run loop — better to fail loudly
than to operate from a malformed config.
